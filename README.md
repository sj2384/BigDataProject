# BigDataProject

timeline:
March 25th: Submit group information
April 10th: Part 1 is due
May 1st: Part 2 and final report due

From 3.22 to 3.25, each of us is going to read and understand each field of the dataset. Then everyone proposes at least 10 different ways to visualize the data filed(s). These should be written in the google doc for this project.

We will meet this weekend to discuss which ideas to choose and split them into three parts, which will be carried out using map-reduce later next week.
